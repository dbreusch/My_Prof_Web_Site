        I have accumulated a wide variety of software and hardware
        skills over my many years working directly (AT&T systems programmer) and
        indirectly (grad school and later) with computers.
        More recently, in spring 2020 I started taking online programming courses
        aimed at two goals: refreshing my existing skills (e.g., Python) and learning
        new skills oriented towards web development (frontend-only and full stack).
        These are described in the Online Courses section below.
      </p>
      <p class="std-paragraph single-para">
        This page attempts to capture this combination of experiences by providing
         brief summaries of my programming & development skills,
        experience with various hardware/OS platforms, and recent
        online courses.

        * This is not Python double-counting but trying to emphasize
        the many different settings where I've used this language.
        In data science, I've made use of modules like
        <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a>/<a
          href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>,

        and interactive analysis and visualization with
        <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> notebooks.
        I have also used Python heavily for general shell scripting

            Experience (⭐️: early days, ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️: years & years)

              How much time have I spent using the language?
            </p>
            <p>
              How long one has used a language is a basic metric for
              proficiency
              since skill normally grows with usage.
              Of course, length of usage doesn't guarantee quality of
              code but
              the two often go together.
            </p>
            <p>
              Experience also transfers to other languages even when
              one hasn't
              used the old one for awhile (for example, by letting you
              skip
              ahead on the learning curve).
              Sometimes this leads to problems (like accidentally
              mixing syntaxes)
              but overall it's a definite benefit to be familiar with
              multiple languages.
              For one thing, it encourages mental flexibility.

            <p>
              Familiarity in all skills normally drops off with the
              length of time
              since you used it last.
              The same is certainly true of programming languages.
              I spent a LOT of time with LISP when I needed it for a
              graduate
              school class -- but I haven't touched it since
              (1993/94!), so I
              doubt I'd be very good with it anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
              Likewise, I used COBOL some during my systems
              programming days at
              AT&T and was able to do some useful things with it.
              Nevertheless,
              I'd be near the front of the learning curve if I were to
              try to
              pick it up again today.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, I'm using Python a lot these days so
              it stays
              pretty fresh.

            Complexity (⭐️: simple, ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️: complex and/or large)
            <p class="padded-para italic-text">
              How complex was my programming in this language?
            </p>
            <p>
              Complexity also matters when evaluating competency.
              I've done a LOT of shell scripting over the years but
              they've mostly
              been small, very task-focused efforts (likewise with
              Python).
              Complex tasks generally bring in bigger issues of how to
              best manage
              the code, how to break up large tasks (modularize,
              abstract) and similar
              topics that don't come up with one-off, short codes.
            </p>
            <p>
              My Computer Science M.Sc. involved a large, complex C++
              application
              (at least it seemed that way at the time!) and I learned
              a lot about C++
              and object-oriented programming from it.

                WRF model</a> for 10+ years has exposed me to a lot of
              "legacy" Fortran and, even though I haven't changed a

              have also learned some useful things about Fortran and
              organizing
              very large application code bases.

              More recently, my full stack development classes have helped
              me learn quite a bit about how best to split functionality to
              support better maintainability and understanding (e.g.,
              putting routes and controllers in separate files or using multiple,
              sharply focused microapps to aid reusability).

        Hardware/Platforms: Current
      </h3>

      <div class="std-paragraph">
        <p>
          I have experience with all the mainstream computing
          platforms, typically with some degree of "power user"
          skills. I am familiar with core system administration skills
          on Macs and Linux after using both heavily in my research
          career (I've admin'd two Linux RAID data servers for more
          than 15 years).
          I have also recently (2019/20) started exploring the iPhone
          world (via apps coded in Swift using Xcode).
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Apple: OS X / macOS (1985; 1994 to present)
            <p class="padded-para">
              I remember an Apple II in my high school library but I
              didn't
              really use Apple products until my robotics class as an
              undergrad.
              That was an early Macintosh and we interfaced it to
              real-world, physical
              objects (like stepper motors) to learn about robotics.
            </p>
            <p>
              I encountered Macs next during grad school. Research
              groups at
              UNH and Penn State favored Macs over PCs and I never
              really looked
              back (they also both had workstation-class machines from
              Sun and SGI,
              but that's another story).
            </p>
            <p>
              I've spent a lot of time with macOS (and OS X before it)
              over the
              years, both as a user and as an administrator (mostly of
              my own machines but also in my Penn State research
              group).
              The latter was usually geared towards customizing my
              environment to
              suit my research needs with occasional forays into
              system upgrades
              and similar endeavors.

            PC: Windows (since ca. 1991)
            <p class="padded-para">
              I have used various versions of Windows on my personal
              PC for more
              than 25 years. The oldest machine replaced an Atari and
              was bought
              as a complete system. That was followed by a laptop,
              another
              off-the-shelf, then I started building my own.
              While I have written two Master's theses, a dissertation
              and multiple
              journal articles on Windows, I haven't done
              a lot of programming or research on this platform.
              The heavy lifting of figure creation, data analysis,
              etc., was
              almost all done elsewhere.

            High-performance computing (since ca. 2002)
            <p class="padded-para">
              I have been an HPC user of machines at Penn State and
              NCAR since
              partway through my Ph.D. program.
              I have used five (I think) generations of supercomputers
              at NCAR (and
              one at UC-Boulder) with a range of operating systems and
              job queuing
              systems.

            PC: Linux (since ca. 2002)
            <p class="padded-para">
              Since late in my Ph.D. program, I've been administering
              (and using!)
              two Linux-based data servers based on off-the-shelf PC
              components.
              I have used both RedHat and Fedora (going Fedora,
              RedHat, back to
              Fedora) and have a reasonable familiarity with what
              needs to be done
              to move systems from one network to another (as I've
              moved about
              the country) and to keep the system secure.

            Apple: iOS (since 2008 as user, 2019 as coder)
            <p class="padded-para">
              I've been an iPhone user for a long time (though not
              quite from
              the beginning).
              I have recently started learning how to write iOS apps
              using Xcode.

          In my former life (1986-1994) as an IBM Systems Programmer,

              mainframes.
              I worked on both software (operating systems) and
              hardware (CPUs,
              disk drives, tape drives, even some older stuff) and
              learned a lot
