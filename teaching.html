        This page summarizes my thoughts on teaching, including my "vision" for an
        approach to teaching, my interest areas, my experience in the classroom,
        and my work with students (graduate and undergraduate, committees and advising).

    <div class="std-paragraph">
      <p>
        I believe that as a teacher in climate science and global change that my students should
        be
        challenged by these four main goals: (1) understand the main elements of the climate
        system
        and their interactions, including a thorough historical
        perspective; (2) recognize the common misconceptions about the evidence for climate change
        and global warming (i.e., the skeptics arguments); (3) understand the uncertainties of
        observations and modeling, both inherent and avoidable; and (4)
        develop a sincere interest in science, what it means to “do science” (i.e., the process),
        and an appreciation of the societal benefits of science.
      </p>
      <p>
        The depth and breadth to which these goals are pursued will of course vary by the nature
        of
        the student. For non-science majors, perhaps taking their only course in this subject area
        (or in science at all), it is important to reach a basic
        competency that will help them in future activities where science is relevant (e.g.,
        should
        I buy that beachfront property? does this politician value science? how can events at the
        poles possibly affect the weather where I live?). In short,
        I want them to leave my class with a set of basic skills that will help them engage with
        these important ideas, have some confidence in making decisions where climate change is a
        factor, and recognize invalid scientific arguments in the
        climate change debate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Students in courses for majors will be expected to dig deeper into these topics and the
        bar
        for achieving each goal will naturally be higher. Topics will also be expanded in breadth,
        e.g., covering more of the skeptics arguments or additional
        details of the climate system. Upper-level courses will also have more collaborative
        learning where students work with each other to develop deeper understanding, e.g., by
        having to explain things to their peers (how often have we heard that
        we don’t really understand something until we try to explain it to someone else). In a
        writing-intensive course, this would include anonymous peer review of student writing, an
        activity that helps students prepare for the experience of
        publishing their own research in journals. There is also scope for student-led original
        research, either as a group activity or as part of a student’s personal curriculum (for
        graduate students or advanced undergraduates).
      </p>
      <p>
        Climate science, particularly in the polar regions, provides many opportunities for
        student
        engagement. Whether it be something easily related to, like the threat to polar bear or
        penguin habitat, or more involved, like feedbacks between sea
        ice and winter storminess in the U.S., there are many ways to connect students with the
        science. News headlines from recent record Arctic sea-ice minima (or less recently, the
        impact of Icelandic volcanic eruptions on air travel) provide
        ready topics for class discussion and study. Climate events and processes such as ENSO,
        drought, hurricanes, and winter storms are also out there waiting to be brought into
        students’ lives – and thereby help them connect with both climate
        science in particular and the more general “idea” of science and its benefits to society.
      </p>
      <p>
        My teaching vision also includes the teacher learning to be a better teacher. Any given
        approach to teaching a topic is unlikely to be born perfect. As our understanding of a
        topic
        changes, so may our approach to sharing it with students.
        Just as our scientific methodologies evolve and improve as our skills mature, so should
        our
        teaching methods. After all, teaching is both an interactive and two-way process that
        should
        also include learning from our students (the most
        polished lecture does little good if it doesn’t connect with the students).

        My teaching interests broadly follow my research interests and encompass the following topic
        areas: (1) components and importance of the global climate system; (2) climate change, past,
        present and future, including paleoclimatology; (3)
        history of climate change science; (4) practical computing skills for student research and
        data analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience to date has been in “global climates”, i.e., what is the climate system and
        what mechanisms and processes are responsible for its fluctuations on different spatial and
        temporal scales. Lectures cover the atmosphere (structure,
        composition, temperature, moisture, circulation), the cryosphere (glaciers, sea ice,
        ice-albedo feedback), hydrosphere (ocean circulation, hydrologic cycle), why the Earth has
        liquid water (energy balance), teleconnections (El Niño-Southern
        Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation), short- and long-term records of climate
        (observations, proxies, landscape), and some climate modeling. My background in ice-core
        science, polar meteorology/climatology, and regional climate modeling
        also brings additional perspectives.
      </p>

        At Penn State I taught versions of this material in two different class settings in the
        Geography department. The smaller (15-20 student) class covers material more in-depth and is
        structured for meeting Penn State requirements for a
        writing-intensive course, i.e., regular writing assignments of various types, an essay
        midterm and a final paper. Effective written communication skills are a key part of
        undergraduate (and graduate!) education adding important value to such
        a course. As at Penn State, this course would be well-suited for department majors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The larger version of this course (up to 80 students) is general education oriented, focuses
        more on the atmospheric sciences and has a weekly lab (I had two TAs for the labs and
        occasional lectures). It would make a nice course for
        non-majors and provide a “science lab” experience (oriented towards the data analysis side
        of climate science).
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also interested in taking the material from these courses and reframing it into a
        course that might be called “Quaternary Paleoclimatology” or “Introduction to
        Paleoclimatology”. That is, a course focused more on paleoclimatology
        (changes over longer times, sources of data and interpretation, long-term proxies, how the
        past may help us predict the future, etc.), data analysis techniques, and Earth history from
        a geological perspective, at global and/or regional scope.
        This course could also be organized as a seminar-style class with more emphasis on
        foundational and recent literature, e.g., as a “Special Topics” course in Climatology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Longer term, I am interested in developing a seminar-type course based on the 2011 book “The
        Warming Papers: The Scientific Foundation for the Climate Change Forecast”, by David Archer
        & Raymond Pierrehumbert. This compendium of foundational
        papers related to greenhouse gases, climate modeling, global warming and climate change
        offers an opportunity to give students a multicentury perspective on these topics, from
        Fourier (1824), Tyndall (1861), and climate icon Svante Arrhenius
        (1896), to key developments of recent decades. Although this material is accessible to
        undergraduates with the right background, it might be best suited as a graduate-level
        offering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stepping away a bit from climate science, another potential course of interest involves less
        science and more practical computing skills for students, i.e., what do students in the
        geosciences, for example, need to know about computing to be
        effective researchers. A course like this, known as “Anything but Excel” at Penn State,
        covers topics such as how data are stored, making life easier with Unix scripting, why basic
        editors are better than using Word for text files, and how to
        do data plotting and basic exploration with Matlab, GMT (Generic Mapping Tools) and other
        applications more appropriate than Excel. Although this is a “course of the future” for me,
        my computer science and research experience should provide
        sufficient background.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, my extensive research experience with artificial neural networks (e.g., in
        downscaling reanalysis data to AWS sites) and self-organizing maps (SOMs) certainly has the
        makings of a new course on applying such tools in meteorology and
        climate science. Such a course (or seminar) would primarily involve material focused on
        methodology (i.e., data preparation, execution of the tool, postprocessing and
        interpretation) accompanied by a range of applications from the literature.
        Students would also have hands-on experience with these tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        In summary, my teaching experience broadly covers “the climate system”, a field of wide
        scientific interest and important societal implications. My existing courses suit department
        undergraduate and graduate students as well as broader
        community interests. Potential future courses further develop these ideas.
