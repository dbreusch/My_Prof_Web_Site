        As a climate scientist interested in polar climate change and variability, my research is motivated most
        by the following topic areas:
      </p>
      <p>
        - Application of numerical forecast and climate modeling (e.g., Polar WRF, CESM) to problems in polar meteorology and climatology (e.g., surface melting on ice sheets);
      </p>
      <p>
        - Improving interpretation of cryospheric records of climate (e.g., accumulation, major ion chemistry,
        >melt layers) through study of cryosphere-atmosphere-ocean interactions;
      </p>
      <p>
        - Development and application of advanced data analysis and visualization tools to aid our understanding of weather/climate variability in time and space.

        My primary research interests revolve around two main themes: understanding climate and climate change in the polar regions and improving the tools we use to analyze the large, complex datasets that are becoming ever more common in climate
        studies globally. I have worked on a number of projects utilizing observed and modeled meteorological datasets, on their own and with ice-core data, in both Antarctica and Greenland. I have also studied Antarctic sea ice variability and
        methods to reconstruct it from ice-core data (an approach that would potentially greatly extend the Antarctic sea ice record in time). Running through all these projects have been efforts to work with and develop new tools for visualizing
        and
        simplifying the complexity and volume of these (and other) geophysical datasets.

        <em>Surface melting on ice sheets</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        My current main research projects are focused on understanding and predicting ice-sheet surface melting through a combination of satellite-based remote sensing and high-resolution regional meteorological modeling. This work started in 2010
        with
        a West Antarctic-focused collaboration with colleagues at Penn State University and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). In September 2013, the scope expanded to Greenland with a new NSF Arctic Natural Sciences award. Both
        projects utilize the polar-optimized version of WRF (Polar WRF) and supercomputing resources at NCAR.

        The general approach used in these projects involves two main stages: (1) modern calibration and performance evaluation and (2) future projections. During calibration we relate the meteorological datasets developed from melt-season Polar WRF
        runs to satellite passive microwave-based surface melt observations to diagnose controls on melting. For this “historical” period, we use the ERA-Interim reanalysis as observational “truth” and boundary conditions for Polar WRF. During
        performance evaluation, we use selected CMIP5 GCMs as Polar WRF boundary conditions to establish the modern skill of these models versus ERA-Interim and surface weather observations. Future projections use the same CMIP5 GCMs to estimate
        changes in surface melting using results from our modern calibrations. Through this work we hope to identify controls on melt as seen in meteorological models that can be used to both interpret recent behavior and predict future melt
        scenarios.

        In West Antarctica we have ERA-Interim-based Polar WRF simulations at high-resolution (45 km outer grid, 15 km nested grid) continent-wide for the austral melt-season months of December and January for 1988/89 to 2007/08 and are working on
        the
        calibration phase. We also have historical (1990-1999), mid- (2050-2059) and late-21st century (2090-2099) runs based on the CCSM4 GCM and are working on adding a second CMIP5 GCM. Planned work for Greenland will build on methods developed in
        Antarctic work but will have numerous additional complexities due to the many geographic and climatic differences between the regions.

        <em>Self-organizing maps and neural networks</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        A big part of the surface melting projects, and many of my other projects (see below), is my research into the problem of extracting meaning from noisy, complex datasets (not exclusively those in polar settings), including improving and
        testing
        the research tools to do this. Many of my tools come from the field of artificial neural networks (ANNs), in particular self-organizing maps (SOMs). The SOM has been an exceptionally valuable method for analyzing variability in numerous
        projects and is gaining wider usage in the geosciences every year. SOMs provide an unsupervised learning-based approach to the analysis of complex datasets (multivariate, multidimensional, large, and/or incomplete) with support for nonlinear
        relationships in the data. A SOM analysis summarizes data variability as a user-selected number of distinct, generalized patterns, or modes. These patterns represent a projection from the multidimensional data space into a two-dimensional,
        spatially organized (by similarity) grid form. Rather than decomposing data into mutually perpendicular, strictly linear principal components, SOMs optimally represent the dataset by a selected number of “icons”, generalized patterns that
        each
        capture the variability of a distinct subset of the input data. Each member of the dataset (e.g., a daily temperature field) maps uniquely to a particular pattern, allowing study of preferred patterns, transitions, and more. Techniques and
        examples of applying this tool in meteorology and climate science were presented in my 2010 paper in Physics and Chemistry of the Earth, “Nonlinear climatology and paleoclimatology: Capturing patterns of variability and change with
        self-organizing maps”.

        <em>Other research areas/projects</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>North Atlantic Oscillation:</strong> In my 2007 JGR paper, “North Atlantic climate variability from a self-organizing map perspective”, I used SOM-based methods to show that wintertime North Atlantic climate between 1957 and 2002
        involved not only the
        well-known trend toward the positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation, but also a strengthening of the Azores high not coupled to weakening of the Icelandic Low. Such work is of relevance to Arctic/Greenland studies through links to
        the
        Arctic Oscillation and effects on the climate of the Greenland ice sheet. The growing number of long-term meteorological reanalysis datasets (e.g., from NASA, ECMWF and others) offers many new opportunities for further study of these
        questions.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Ice cores and climate:</strong> SOMs and ANNs also featured in my 2005 paper in the International Journal of Climatology (“Towards Ice Core-based Synoptic Reconstructions of West Antarctic Climate with Artificial Neural Networks”),
        where I developed a
        methodology for improved reconstruction of climate from ice-core data. SOMs first classify reanalysis data into preferred synoptic patterns, to simplify the meteorology. ANNs then upscale from ice-core data to the synoptic patterns, building
        a
        synoptic history from associated ice-core data. This work demonstrated that ice-core data can be used to objectively reconstruct synoptic patterns prior to the reanalysis era (pre-1979 in the Antarctic due to relative lack of direct
        observations in high southern latitudes), and added a useful new technique to the toolbox for reconstructions of Antarctic paleoclimate.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Polar weather station records:</strong> ANNs were used heavily as a downscaling tool in my 2004 JGR paper (“A 15-year West Antarctic climatology from six automatic weather station temperature and pressure records”). With the harsh
        climate and lack of
        year-round access, it is common for Antarctic AWS to have missing data, sometimes for extensive periods (e.g., full winter seasons). ANNs provided a way to predict these missing data by downscaling from gridded reanalysis data (ERA-15) and
        thereby produce complete records better suited to climatology studies. This approach allowed me to extract novel climatological information from six AWS across West Antarctica (e.g., the abnormally warm winters of 1988 and 1989 at Byrd
        Station).
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Antarctic sea ice:</strong> I have also applied SOMs and ANNs to Antarctic sea ice analyses and reconstructions. My 2007 Annals of Glaciology paper (see “Antarctic sea ice: a self-organizing map-based perspective”) developed a new
        climatology of sea
        ice
        extent over the annual cycle. ANNs were used in as-yet unpublished work to reconstruct sea-ice edge from ice-core data (see AGU and other presentations).
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Greenland:</strong> While recent work has focused on Antarctica, I have also applied these methods to topics in Greenland, such as new ways to develop accumulation histories from ice cores and alternative approaches to reconstructing
        surface mass
        balance.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Future Projects</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        With respect to possible future research, I am also exploring a new collaborative project that uses satellite data, ground-based radar observations, meteorological modeling and field-based process studies to better understand and predict
        Antarctic snowfall. This work will involve colleagues in atmospheric sciences, glaciology and satellite remote sensing in both the U.S. and Europe.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also have a pending proposal to build on our current Antarctic project with new higher-resolution meteorological modeling and surface melting data (scatterometer) focused on the Getz Ice Shelf. This project would also expand the range of
        CMIP5 GCMs.

      <p>
        My research focuses on the polar regions but applies tools and skills that are relevant to a much wider range of datasets, not just those from meteorology and climate, “recent” times or just the high latitudes. My research projects offer
        chances for students to learn about both global climate modeling and regional forecast modeling with a polar focus, and how to interpret the large datasets these models create. There is also great societal relevance as our polar climates
        continue to change in unexpected ways (among many examples: the regular new minima in Arctic sea ice extent and the nearly unprecedented 2012 full-ice-sheet surface melting in Greenland).
