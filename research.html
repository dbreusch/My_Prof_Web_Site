        My research focuses on the polar regions but applies tools and skills that are relevant to a
        much wider range of datasets, not just those from meteorology and climate, “recent” times or
        just the high latitudes. My research projects offer
        chances for students to learn about both global climate modeling and regional forecast
        modeling with a polar focus, and how to interpret the large datasets these models create.
        There is also great societal relevance as our polar climates
        continue to change in unexpected ways (among many examples: the regular new minima in Arctic
        sea ice extent and the nearly unprecedented 2012 full-ice-sheet surface melting in
        Greenland).

        My primary research interests revolve around two main themes: understanding climate and
        climate change in the polar regions and improving the tools we use to analyze the large,
        complex datasets that are becoming ever more common in climate
        studies globally. I have worked on a number of projects utilizing observed and modeled
        meteorological datasets, on their own and with ice-core data, in both Antarctica and
        Greenland. I have also studied Antarctic sea ice variability and
        methods to reconstruct it from ice-core data (an approach that would potentially greatly
        extend the Antarctic sea ice record in time). Running through all these projects have been
        efforts to work with and develop new tools for visualizing
        and
        simplifying the complexity and volume of these (and other) geophysical datasets.

        <em>Surface melting on ice sheets</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        My current main research projects are focused on understanding and predicting ice-sheet
        surface melting through a combination of satellite-based remote sensing and
        high-resolution
        regional meteorological modeling. This work started in 2010
        with
        a West Antarctic-focused collaboration with colleagues at Penn State University and the
        National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). In September 2013, the scope expanded to
        Greenland with a new NSF Arctic Natural Sciences award. Both
        projects utilize the polar-optimized version of WRF (Polar WRF) and supercomputing
        resources
        at NCAR.

        The general approach used in these projects involves two main stages: (1) modern
        calibration
        and performance evaluation and (2) future projections. During calibration we relate the
        meteorological datasets developed from melt-season Polar WRF
        runs to satellite passive microwave-based surface melt observations to diagnose controls
        on
        melting. For this “historical” period, we use the ERA-Interim reanalysis as observational
        “truth” and boundary conditions for Polar WRF. During
        performance evaluation, we use selected CMIP5 GCMs as Polar WRF boundary conditions to
        establish the modern skill of these models versus ERA-Interim and surface weather
        observations. Future projections use the same CMIP5 GCMs to estimate
        changes in surface melting using results from our modern calibrations. Through this work
        we
        hope to identify controls on melt as seen in meteorological models that can be used to
        both
        interpret recent behavior and predict future melt
        scenarios.

        In West Antarctica we have ERA-Interim-based Polar WRF simulations at high-resolution (45
        km
        outer grid, 15 km nested grid) continent-wide for the austral melt-season months of
        December
        and January for 1988/89 to 2007/08 and are working on
        the
        calibration phase. We also have historical (1990-1999), mid- (2050-2059) and late-21st
        century (2090-2099) runs based on the CCSM4 GCM and are working on adding a second CMIP5
        GCM. Planned work for Greenland will build on methods developed in
        Antarctic work but will have numerous additional complexities due to the many geographic
        and
        climatic differences between the regions.

        <em>Self-organizing maps and neural networks</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        A big part of the surface melting projects, and many of my other projects (see below), is
        my
        research into the problem of extracting meaning from noisy, complex datasets (not
        exclusively those in polar settings), including improving and
        testing
        the research tools to do this. Many of my tools come from the field of artificial neural
        networks (ANNs), in particular self-organizing maps (SOMs). The SOM has been an
        exceptionally valuable method for analyzing variability in numerous
        projects and is gaining wider usage in the geosciences every year. SOMs provide an
        unsupervised learning-based approach to the analysis of complex datasets (multivariate,
        multidimensional, large, and/or incomplete) with support for nonlinear
        relationships in the data. A SOM analysis summarizes data variability as a user-selected
        number of distinct, generalized patterns, or modes. These patterns represent a projection
        from the multidimensional data space into a two-dimensional,
        spatially organized (by similarity) grid form. Rather than decomposing data into mutually
        perpendicular, strictly linear principal components, SOMs optimally represent the dataset
        by
        a selected number of “icons”, generalized patterns that
        each
        capture the variability of a distinct subset of the input data. Each member of the dataset
        (e.g., a daily temperature field) maps uniquely to a particular pattern, allowing study of
        preferred patterns, transitions, and more. Techniques and
        examples of applying this tool in meteorology and climate science were presented in my
        2010
        paper in Physics and Chemistry of the Earth, “Nonlinear climatology and paleoclimatology:
        Capturing patterns of variability and change with
        self-organizing maps”.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Other research areas/projects</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>North Atlantic Oscillation:</strong> In my 2007 JGR paper, “North Atlantic climate
        variability from a self-organizing map perspective”, I used SOM-based methods to show that
        wintertime North Atlantic climate between 1957 and 2002
        involved not only the
        well-known trend toward the positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation, but also a
        strengthening of the Azores high not coupled to weakening of the Icelandic Low. Such work
        is
        of relevance to Arctic/Greenland studies through links to
        the
        Arctic Oscillation and effects on the climate of the Greenland ice sheet. The growing
        number
        of long-term meteorological reanalysis datasets (e.g., from NASA, ECMWF and others) offers
        many new opportunities for further study of these
        questions.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Ice cores and climate:</strong> SOMs and ANNs also featured in my 2005 paper in
        the
        International Journal of Climatology (“Towards Ice Core-based Synoptic Reconstructions of
        West Antarctic Climate with Artificial Neural Networks”),
        where I developed a
        methodology for improved reconstruction of climate from ice-core data. SOMs first classify
        reanalysis data into preferred synoptic patterns, to simplify the meteorology. ANNs then
        upscale from ice-core data to the synoptic patterns, building
        a
        synoptic history from associated ice-core data. This work demonstrated that ice-core data
        can be used to objectively reconstruct synoptic patterns prior to the reanalysis era
        (pre-1979 in the Antarctic due to relative lack of direct
        observations in high southern latitudes), and added a useful new technique to the toolbox
        for reconstructions of Antarctic paleoclimate.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Polar weather station records:</strong> ANNs were used heavily as a downscaling
        tool
        in my 2004 JGR paper (“A 15-year West Antarctic climatology from six automatic weather
        station temperature and pressure records”). With the harsh
        climate and lack of
        year-round access, it is common for Antarctic AWS to have missing data, sometimes for
        extensive periods (e.g., full winter seasons). ANNs provided a way to predict these
        missing
        data by downscaling from gridded reanalysis data (ERA-15) and
        thereby produce complete records better suited to climatology studies. This approach
        allowed
        me to extract novel climatological information from six AWS across West Antarctica (e.g.,
        the abnormally warm winters of 1988 and 1989 at Byrd
        Station).
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Antarctic sea ice:</strong> I have also applied SOMs and ANNs to Antarctic sea ice
        analyses and reconstructions. My 2007 Annals of Glaciology paper (see “Antarctic sea ice:
        a
        self-organizing map-based perspective”) developed a new
        climatology of sea
        ice
        extent over the annual cycle. ANNs were used in as-yet unpublished work to reconstruct
        sea-ice edge from ice-core data (see AGU and other presentations).
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Greenland:</strong> While recent work has focused on Antarctica, I have also
        applied
        these methods to topics in Greenland, such as new ways to develop accumulation histories
        from ice cores and alternative approaches to reconstructing
        surface mass
        balance.
